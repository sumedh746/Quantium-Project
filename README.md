# Project Overview

The objective was to delieve valuable insights into preferences of the customer and determine the success of trial, providing data-drive recommendations to the client.

# Task 1- Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Files: Quantium_Task_1, reads QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv and QVI_transaction_data.xlsx.
* Data Cleaning: Standardized column names, reformatted the date values, and removed unnecessary numbers and extra spaces for consistency. Filtered out entries related to salsa products and excluded them from the dataset. Identified and removed outliers to ensure data accuracy. Added a new column, "Brand", derived from prod_name, and validated brand names to correct inconsistencies, such as merging pairs like "Snbts" and "Sunbites" and "Infzns" and "Infuzions" into their proper forms.
