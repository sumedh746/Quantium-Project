# Quantium- Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program.
This repository contains the analysis and insights generated from the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program. Using R Programming, this project dives into customer behaviour, sales trends, and market insights to help optimize retail strategies. 

# Project Overview
This experience program focused on analyzing chip purchases in retail giants to better understand customer buying behaviours. The objective was to analyze the customer purchasing behaviours and assess the impact of a new store layout implemented in trial stores. The objective was to delieve valuable insights into preferences of the customer and determine the success of trial, providing data-drive recommendations to the client.

# Task 1- Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Files: Quantium_Task_1, reads QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv and QVI_transaction_data.xlsx.
* Data Cleaning: Standardized column names, reformatted the date values, and removed unnecessary numbers and extra spaces for consistency. Filtered out entries related to salsa products and excluded them from the dataset. Identified and removed outliers to ensure data accuracy. Added a new column, "Brand", derived from prod_name, and validated brand names to correct inconsistencies, such as merging pairs like "Snbts" and "Sunbites" and "Infzns" and "Infuzions" into their proper forms.
* Data Analysis on Customer Segments: There are 4 main questions in this analysis,
  1. Who spends the most on chips, describing customers by life stage and how premium their general purchase behaviour is?
  2.  How many customers are in each segment?
  3.  How many chips are brought per customer by segment?
  4.  What's the average chip price by customer segment?
